***Telegram bot***

This program is used to solve a scientific problem. There is a program for calculating electric fields, but it has poor visualization. But, fortunately, from this program you can get an array of data in a special format. This program is used to process this array and visualize the data in a visual format.

This bot differs from the program in the way that there is no function for cropping part of image.

Bot is hosted by ***Heroku***.

You can find it on Telegram: @array2heatmap_bot. But specific format of file is needed.
